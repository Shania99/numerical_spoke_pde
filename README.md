# Interdisciplinary Numerical Methods: Numerical PDEs "Spoke" 18.S191/16.S091

This repository holds materials the second 6-unit "spoke" half of a new MIT course (**Spring 2025**) introducing numerical methods and numerical analysis to a broad audience.   18.S191/16.S091 covers **Numerical PDEs**: Finite Difference and Finite Volume
**Syllabus:**
* Units: 6 (2nd half of term)
* Prerequisites: 18.C330 (“hub”)
* Grading: 60% problem sets, 40% final project

This course focuses on numerical methods for modeling physical systems, especially systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs), with a variety of examples drawn from different areas of science and engineering. Likely topics include:
1. Finite-difference methods: accuracy and implementation.
2. Initial value problems: Convergence, consistency, stiffness, and explicit/implicit methods. Method of lines.
3. Finite volume methods
4. Nonlinear PDEs: split-step and other methods
5. Applications including waves, diffusion, incompressible flow

Students will complete weekly homework assignments, as well as a final project investigating the modeling of a physical system (typically a PDE) not directly covered in class, and/or a numerical method significantly different from those covered in class. 


**Instructor**: [Prof. Qiqi Wang](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/qiqi-wang/).

**Lectures**: MWF10 in 2-142 (Feb 3 – Mar 31), slides and notes posted below.  Lecture videos posted in [Panopto Video on Canvas](https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/32079/external_tools/369).

**Grading** (all assignments **submitted electronically** via [Gradescope on Canvas](https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/32076/external_tools/369)):
* 50% **4 weekly psets:** due Fridays at midnight: April 11, 18, 25, May 2.
* 50% **final project**: due May 12 (last day of class).

**Collaboration policy:** Talk to anyone you want to and read anything you want to, with two caveats: First, make a solid effort to solve a problem on your own before discussing it with classmates or googling. Second, no matter whom you talk to or what you read, write up the solution on your own, without having their answer in front of you (this includes ChatGPT and similar). (You can use [psetpartners.mit.edu](https://psetpartners.mit.edu/) to find problem-set partners.)
